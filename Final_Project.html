    <h2> "The ultrasonic sensor ruler "</h2>
    <p>For my final project,i have chosen to design and create a ultrasonic sensor ruler

<h3>Original Idea/concept:</h3>Originally, i wanted to create a "shy box" which closes when someone approaches it. However, it didnt seem like a good idea as it was impratical and didnt help solve any problems i had.

<h3>New idea</h3>The new idea was to create a ultrasonic sensor ruler,which could determine the distance of between the user and a wall or object.This is particularly useful if you are an engineer and need to quickly get simple measurements.
<p>This new idea was more practical and much more useful.</p>

  <h3>Bill of materials:</h3>A bill of materials or product structure is a list of the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components, parts, and the quantities of each needed to manufacture an end product

<h3>Cable connections</h3>
The cable connections for this new idea is fairly simple, as it contains only wiring for one LCD display and one ultrasonic sensor.
</br>

</br>
Luckily, the LCD display was fitted with a module that only had 4 pins,VCC,GND,SDA,SLC.
</br>
<h3>connections are as follows:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>ultrasonic VCC ->Arduino pin VCC</li>
  <li>ultrasonic GND->Arduino pin GND</li>
  <li>ultrasonic TRIG->Arduino pin 12</li>
  <li>ultrasonic ECHO->Arduino pin 13 </li>
  <li>LCD display VCC-> Arduino pin VCC </li>
  <li>LCD display GND-> Arduino pin GND </li>
  <li>LCD display SDA-> Arduino pin A4 </li>
  <li>LCD display SCL-> Arduino pin A5 </li>

</ul>

<h3>Arduino Coding</h3>
<p>The coding was originally almost 60 lines of code but i have found a simpler method of coding in the form of libraries.</p>
Libraries are a compilation of previously done codes which allows for special commands. Libraries can be added by downloading ZIP files from online platforms such as   <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/libraries"><b><u>Arduino Libraries</b></u></a>
</br>
Adding libraries are simple just use the "#include libraries" command at the start of your arduino code</br>

The completed code looks like this</br>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
</br>
<p>After spending much time on the project, i had finally managed to get the whole project to life, which meant that it was finally working and i was very excited to try it out.</br>
Please understand that the end product currently is still a prototype and there is still much room for improvement.Which includes:
<ul>
  <li>3d printing housing for the components</li>
  <li>Adding lighting to the front of the box</li>
  </p>

</ul></br>
